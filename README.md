OVERVIEW 
The project that will be developed for the ICS3U final project is a 2D side-scrolling game. 
Players progress through different obstacles (e.g. rocks, animals) and levels of difficulty
(i.e. the game speed increases) by answering timed trivia questions. Every correct
answer will enable the player to avoid obstacles and increase their score. This 
side-scrolling game will enable the user to enhance their understanding of a wide variety 
of trivia topics while engaging in a fun-filled activity.
